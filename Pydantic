1. __init__ Method
Automatically Generated: Pydantic generates an __init__ method for your data model classes. This method initializes the model's attributes based on the values passed when creating an instance.
Behavior: The __init__ method handles the assignment of values to attributes and performs data validation and type conversion.
2. __repr__ Method
Automatically Generated: Pydantic provides a __repr__ method that generates a string representation of the model instance. This representation includes the class name and the values of its attributes, making it easier to inspect the object.
Behavior: The generated __repr__ is useful for debugging and logging because it shows the model's data in a readable format.
3. __eq__ Method
Automatically Generated: Pydantic also generates an __eq__ method to enable equality comparison between instances of the model.
Behavior: This method compares the values of all the attributes to determine if two instances are equal. If all attributes have the same values, the instances are considered equal.
4. __hash__ Method
Automatically Generated: If your model is hashable (i.e., if it meets the conditions for hashing), Pydantic generates a __hash__ method.
Behavior: The __hash__ method allows instances of the model to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets. This is generally generated if all the fields are immutable and hashable.
